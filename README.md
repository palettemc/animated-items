### Tool Trims Mod

There is also animation support for the [Tool Trims](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tool-trims) mod, with 160 textures being animated. Those animations are the iron, gold, diamond, and netherite swords with all of their possible combinations.

_For the animation to work properly, ensure that you have both the Tool Trims resource pack and Animated Items resource pack turned on with Animated Items going above Tool Trims in the resource pack list._

Here's an example of the Diamond Sword with 4 possible trimmings (in gold):

*Order of trimmings from left to right: Linear, Tracks, Charge, Frost*

### Combat Expansion

Animated Items comes with animation support for the [Combat Expansion](https://modrinth.com/datapack/cmbt-exp) data pack. The new swords from the data pack (katanas, claymores, and daggers) have been animated as well as the cutlass weapon.

The animations are the same as the iron, gold, diamond, and netherite swords from the vanilla game.

## üìã Requirements
OptiFine is **not** required for this resource pack to work. Only versions of Minecraft starting from 1.6 and above, no versions before 1.6 will work since texture animations were added in Minecraft 1.6.

For versions 1.4 and above, the [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) or [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/) mod is needed **only** for emissive textures.

## üìÉ Information on other Resource Packs
If you are using resource packs that change the textures of any of the ones that this one changes (view the list called "Items with an Animation" above), they will **not** be compatible since one will overlap the other. So that means that it's either you use custom textures without animations, or animations without custom textures.
