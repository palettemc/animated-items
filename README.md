# Animated Items for Minecraft 1.18+

Animated Items is a resource pack that animates some textures of Minecraft items. This resource pack works with versions 1.18 and above.

*Please note that this resource pack is still adding more animations to items*

## Items with an Animation
So far, here are the items that have been animated:

**Version 1.0**
- Totem of Undying
- Lava Bucket
- Slime Ball
- Eye of Ender
- Iron Ingot
- Gold Ingot
- Copper Ingot
- Emerald
- Diamond

**Version 1.1**
- Iron Sword
- Golden Sword
- Diamond Sword

*As more items arrive to Minecraft, more items will be animated*

*Totem of Undying*

*Diamond*

## Requirements
OptiFine is **not** required for this resource pack to work. Only versions of Minecraft starting from 1.6 and above, no versions before 1.6 will work since texture animations were added in Minecraft 1.6.

## Information on other Resource Packs
If you are using resource packs which change the textures of any of the ones that this one changes (view the list called "Items with an Animation" above), they will **NOT** be compatible since one of them will overlap the other. So that means that it's either you use custom textures without animations, or animations without custom textures.

## Download
This resource pack can be downloaded on the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/animated-items/versions).
